This is a series of mini blogs for documenting some of the controller runtime features. 

In Kubernetes, some objects are owner of other objects. For example, a ReplicaSet is the owner of a set of Pods. These owned objects are dependents of their owners.
The dependents objects has references to all owners objects under `metadata.ownerReferences` field. Read more about [owners and dependents](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/)

A kubernetes custom resources can set itself as owner of the other resources, it creates as part of it's reconciliation logic. `controller-runtime` has two utility methods to set owner references on an object.

* `func SetControllerReference(owner, controlled metav1.Object, scheme *runtime.Scheme, ...) error`

SetControllerReference sets owner as a Controller OwnerReference on controlled. This is used for garbage collection of the controlled object and for reconciling the owner object on changes to controlled (with a Watch + EnqueueRequestForOwner). Since only one OwnerReference can be a controller, it returns an error if there is another OwnerReference with Controller flag set.

* `func SetOwnerReference(owner, object metav1.Object, scheme *runtime.Scheme, ...) error`

SetOwnerReference is a helper method to make sure the given object contains an object references to the object provided. This allows you to declare that owner has a dependency on the object without specifying it as a controller.


When you need to declare a dependency on an object without reconciling changes from the owner when the dependent changes, use `SetOwnerReference`. If you need to reconcile the owner for changes in the dependent object or to garbage collect the dependent when the owner is deleted, use `SetControllerReference`.


To establish controller ownership on a `Deployment` object created by the custom resource `MyCustomApp`

```golang
// Set the controller ownerRef for the Deployment
myApp := MyCustomApp{...}
if err := ctrl.SetControllerReference(myApp, dep, r.Scheme); err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
```

Setting the controller owner reference will automatically manage the garbage collection of the dependent resources, but it wonâ€™t trigger reconciliation of the owner object when the dependent resources change. To observe the changes on the dependent resource, we need add `Owns` when setting up conrtoller with the controller manager.

```golang
// SetupWithManager sets up the controller with the Manager.
// Note that the Deployment will be also watched in order to ensure its
// desirable state on the cluster
func (r *MemcachedReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
    return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
    For(&examplecomv1alpha1.MyCustomApp{}). ## Create watches for the MyCustomApp Kind
    Owns(&appsv1.Deployment{}). ## Create watches for the Deployment which has its controller owned reference
    Complete(r)
}
```
